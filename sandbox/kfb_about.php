                                                <p>
                                                      In 2010 the food bank was able to upgrade our computer system and hardware to better accommodate our increasing client needs.  Our old
                                                      rogram was not upgradable and clients had to wait longer in line while we worked around our program.  A retired Boeing employee wrote a
                                                      new program in Access that is completly upgradable and is easier for our volunteers.  By doing this clients now wait a fraction of time
                                                      in line at a food bank.  With the high demand and growth in the last few years the food bank has had to be very creative in ways to meet
                                                      the demands of the high need.  The number of clients continues to grow and being able to distribute the same amount of nutitious food to
                                                      all has been difficult.  We rely heavily on donations and the Kent Community has been very genourous and thus far we are doing well and
                                                      meeting the needs of our clients.
